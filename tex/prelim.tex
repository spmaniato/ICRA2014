\subsection{Controller Synthesis}\label{preliminariesA}

We present an overview of our reactive controller synthesis process. We refer the reader to \cite{KGFP_TRO09} for a detailed presentation.

\subsubsection*{Discrete Abstraction}

First, the robot's workspace is partitioned using a finite number of cells. The Boolean region propositions $\mathcal{R} = \left\{r_1, r_2, \ldots, r_{N_1} \right\}$ denote the location of the robot in the partition, and are thus mutually exclusive. In addition, the robot can perform actions $\mathcal{A} = \left\{\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \ldots, \alpha_{N_2} \right\}$, which can involve the use of actuators, e.g. grasping an object, turning an on-board camera on, or the activation of memory propositions, e.g. having visited a region at least once. Region and action propositions together form the set of \emph{robot} propositions $\mathcal{Y} = \mathcal{R} \cup \mathcal{A}$.

Furthermore, the robot has sensors, whose value, whether continuous or discrete, is abstracted by the Boolean \emph{environment}/\emph{sensor} propositions $\mathcal{X} = \left\{ x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_{N_3} \right\}$. 
The sensor propositions allow the robot to react to its environment. 
%Together, $\mathcal{X}$ and $\mathcal{Y}$ are the discrete abstraction of the world.

\subsubsection*{Linear Temporal Logic}

We are interested in missions with complex requirements, such as surveillance, avoidance, and response to events. 
Thus, we use Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formulas to specify the desired high-level behaviors. LTL consists of Boolean ($\neg, \wedge, \lor$) and temporal (next, $\X$, and until, $\mathcal{U}$) operators. 
Additional temporal operators, eventually, $\F$, and always, $\G$, can be derived. 
In our setting, LTL formulas are constructed from atomic propositions $\pi \in AP = \mathcal{X} \cup \mathcal{Y}$. 
The semantics of an LTL formula $\varphi$ are defined over an infinite sequence $\sigma$ of truth assignments to the atomic propositions. 
Let $t \in \NN$ be the position index of $\sigma$. Then, $\sigma (t)$ denotes the subset of propositions $\pi \in AP$ that are \texttt{True} at position $t$ of the sequence $\sigma$, and $\pi [t]$ denotes the valuation of a particular proposition.

\subsubsection*{Reactive Synthesis}
Specifically, we use the GR(1) fragment of LTL, because its synthesis is tractable \cite{piterman_06}. GR(1) formulas $\varphi$ have an assume-guarantee structure between the environment ($e$) and the robot (system, $s$):
\begin{align*}
	\varphi &= (\varphi_e \Rightarrow \varphi_s),\\
	\varphi_e &= \varphi_i^e \wedge \varphi_t^e \wedge \varphi_g^e,\\
	\varphi_s &= \varphi_i^s \wedge \varphi_t^s \wedge \varphi_g^s
\end{align*}
where $i$ denotes initial conditions, $t$ safety assumptions/requirements, and $g$ liveness assumptions/requirements (goals) for the environment and the robot, respectively.

For example, to specify the robot task ``starting in region $r_1$, repeatedly visit the region $r_2$ if you are not sensing a fire", we would write: $r_1 \wedge \left(\X(\neg x_{\text{alarm}}) \Rightarrow \G\F r_2 \right)$.

If the formula $\varphi$ is realizable, a discrete robot strategy $\mathcal{S}$ is computed by solving a two-player game between the robot and the environment (adversarial player) \cite{piterman_06}. The strategy, which is guaranteed to be winning for the robot, is augmented with simple low-level controllers to form a hybrid controller \cite{KGFP_TRO09}.

\subsection{LTL Mission Planning}\label{preliminariesB}
% TODO: Rename section to "LTL from Structured English" ?

The Linear Temporal Logic Mission Planning (LTLMoP) toolkit \cite{Finucane2010} is a Python-based, open-source toolkit for controlling physical and simulated robots using high-level behavior specifications.\footnote{http://ltlmop.github.io} 
LTLMoP allows users to specify missions in either pure LTL, natural language, via a module called SLURP \cite{RamanRSS2013}, or a formal grammar called Structured English \cite{JFRKGICRA12}. Structured English is the most commonly used specification language and will be used for demonstration in this paper. Specifications in Structured English are parsed using a feature-based context-free grammar and translated into formulas of LTL for controller synthesis.

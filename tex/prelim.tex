This section provides the background information on which the remainder of the paper will build on. First, we present an overview of the blocks that comprise the controller synthesis process (discrete abstraction, logic formulas, synthesis). Then, we briefly present the aspects of the LTLMoP (Linear Temporal Logic MissiOn Planning) toolkit that are pertinent to this paper.

\subsection{Controller Synthesis}

\begin{itemize}
	\item discrete abstraction (region, action, environment propositions)
	\item linear temporal logic (super-short)
	\item reactivity: GR(1) assume-guarantee, 6 sub-formulas
	\item synthesis, discrete strategy
	\item hybrid controller
\end{itemize}

\subsection{LTL Mission Planning}

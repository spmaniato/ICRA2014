In order to demonstrate our proposed approach to open world mission planning, we present two simulation examples. For clarity, each one will focus on a different aspect of the approach. The first one (Example \ref{Ex:mailbot3}) is an example of augmenting the state-space via new sensor and action propositions. The second one (Example \ref{Ex:planetxplore}) is mainly focused on the exploration of the robot's physical workspace. In both cases, new elements of the open world result in additional liveness requirements (mission goals) for the robot to pursue.

%\begin{myExample}\label{Ex:planetxplore} Autonomous Planetary Exploration\\
%	Consider now the more futuristic scenario of autonomous planetary exploration using rovers. In order to lessen the dependency of the rover from the engineers on Earth, the rover will be given a mission specification that it should carry out autonomously. However, the need to redefine the mission will arise as the rover discovers interesting elements of its environment, such as new types of rock and regions interest. In these cases, the engineers and scientists on Earth should be able to extend the rover's mission specification without sacrificing correctness or rewriting the specification from scratch.

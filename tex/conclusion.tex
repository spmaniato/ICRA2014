Discussion on issues:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Disadvantage of including ``exploration task" in specification: extra propositions, not just LTL any more.
	\item The approach doesn't address the state-explosion problem. At some point, the synthesis algorithm won't be able to deal with the size of the state-space.
\end{itemize}¥

Therefore, future work:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Local/Incremental re-synthesis
	\item Ask user for feedback re newly discovered propositions via a dialogue interface.
	\item First-order logic: Set manipulations during execution, specs like ``do action iff Group is empty", \ldots
	\item Modular robots can create new actuators (action propositions)
\end{itemize}¥

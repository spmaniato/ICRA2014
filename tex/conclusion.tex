Discussion:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Summary
	\item As demonstrated in Example \ref{Ex:SnS}, the rewriting rules and the time of re-synthesis are defined in the spec; by the user (unlike lit).
	\item \ldots
\end{itemize}

Future work:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Open World Model allowed to contract, not only expand.
	\item Local/Incremental re-synthesis
	\item Prompt user for feedback re newly discovered propositions via a dialogue interface.
	\item First-order logic: Set manipulations during execution, specs like ``do action iff Group is empty", \ldots
	\item Modular robots can create new actuators (action propositions)
\end{itemize}¥

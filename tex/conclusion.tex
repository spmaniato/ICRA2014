In this paper, we presented an approach to specifying and updating robot mission that take place in worlds open with respect to new elements, such as new objects and regions of interest. During execution, we automatically model the new elements as propositions, which we incorporate into the mission specification on-the-fly. This is possible via (i) \emph{open-world abstractions}, which allow us to specify high-level behaviors without explicitly referring to individual propositions, and (ii) the \emph{add to Group} mechanism, which systematically augments subsets of propositions with new elements. Our approach lets the user specify how the new propositions will be incorporated into the mission, and when the updates will be reflected in the robot's execution strategy.

Future work:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Open World Model allowed to contract, not only expand.
	\item Local/Incremental re-synthesis
	\item Prompt user for feedback re newly discovered propositions via a dialogue interface.
	\item First-order logic: Set manipulations during execution, specs like ``do action iff Group is empty", \ldots
	\item Modular robots can create new actuators (action propositions)
\end{itemize}¥

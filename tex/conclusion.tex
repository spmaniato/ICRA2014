Discussion on issues:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Open World is only allowed to increase (for now).
	\item \ldots
\end{itemize}¥

Therefore, future work:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Open World Model allowed to contract, not only expand.
	\item Local/Incremental re-synthesis
	\item Ask user for feedback re newly discovered propositions via a dialogue interface.
	\item First-order logic: Set manipulations during execution, specs like ``do action iff Group is empty", \ldots
	\item Modular robots can create new actuators (action propositions)
\end{itemize}¥
